## Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to provide clear and practical examples of common data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. The repository includes both classic and advanced topics to cater to a range of needs from learning to applying these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Implementations include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees (binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees), heaps, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Includes sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.), searching algorithms (binary search, depth-first search, breadth-first search), and graph algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm).
- **Complexity Analysis**: Each implementation includes an analysis of time and space complexity.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `data_structures/`: Contains implementations of various data structures.
  - `arrays/`
  - `linked_lists/`
  - `stacks/`
  - `queues/`
  - `hash_tables/`
  - `trees/`
  - `heaps/`
  - `graphs/`

- `algorithms/`: Contains implementations of various algorithms.
  - `sorting/`
  - `searching/`
  - `graph_algorithms/`

- `examples/`: Contains example programs that demonstrate the use of the data structures and algorithms.

## Usage

To use the implementations in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-cpp.git
   cd dsa-cpp
Compile and Run

Navigate to the directory of the implementation you want to test, and compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

bash
Copy code
g++ -o example example.cpp
./example
Replace example.cpp with the relevant file you wish to compile and run.

Explore the Code

Review the code and comments to understand how each data structure and algorithm is implemented. Refer to the example programs in the examples/ directory for practical applications.
